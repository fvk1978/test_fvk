=====

Tasks is a simple Django app to manipulate tasks. 
Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

Quick start
-----------
sudo bower install --force-latest
mv bower_components ./tasks/static/
sudo pip install


1. Add "tasks" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'tasks',
    ]

2. Include the tasks URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    url(r'^tasks/', include('tasks.urls')),

3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the polls models.

4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).

5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/ to test.
